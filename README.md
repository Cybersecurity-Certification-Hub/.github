# European Cluster for Cybersecurity Certification

The European Cluster of Cybersecurity Certification is envisioned to provide a forum for discussion and collaboration for research and innovation initiatives that address the challenges and issues of Next Generation Agile Certification from various perspectives and approaches. Its main objective is to foster collaboration among existing research initiatives, creating a critical mass of projects to share experiences, collaborate on approaches in order to elaborate a broad EU perspective, and discuss challenges for adoption and future research.
